### Project Description
In this project, I familiarized myself with Twitters 
API with a TWITTERDEVELOPER account. This project
allows users to obtain at most 10 tweets from a date
that they have inputted. The restrictions are that the 
inputed date has to be from the last 7 days. 

### Technology/Languages used

For this project the main file was written using python. 
This project also includes a unit testing file written in python
This project uses data collected from twitter to create a database
of tweets that is formatted for the user using SQL and pandas 
This project also includes a workflows folder that checks 
the style and does the unit testing for the program.
